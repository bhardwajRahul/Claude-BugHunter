# claude-bughunter

> A self-contained Claude skill bundle for bug hunting · **40 skills** · 15 slash commands · **574+ disclosed-report patterns** across 24 vulnerability classes · engagement-folder scaffolding · Burp MCP integration · battle-tested through real Bugcrowd engagements.

Built by **[ElementalSoul](https://github.com/elementalsouls)** — Bug Bounty & GenAI Security Research.

## What is this?

`claude-bughunter` is a drop-in skill bundle for the [Claude Code skills system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Install once and Claude Code stops being a chatbot and starts behaving like a senior bug-bounty researcher: it knows the techniques, the chain templates, the VRT mappings, and the hygiene — and it stays in scope.

Three layers stack:

- **`bug-bounty` + `bb-methodology`** — *how to think.* 5-phase non-linear hunting workflow, critical-thinking framework, developer-psychology heuristics, anomaly detection patterns.
- **24 `hunt-*` skills + `security-arsenal`** — *what to look for.* Per-class detection patterns, payloads, bypass tables, and chain templates curated from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports.
- **`triage-validation` + `bugcrowd-reporting` + `evidence-hygiene`** — *how to ship it.* 7-Question Gate, VRT category fallback, severity-request paragraphs, OOS rebuttals, cookie/PII redaction protocols.

All triggered automatically by topic — describe what you're testing in plain English and the relevant skill loads. No invocation by name.

> **40 skills · 15 commands · 574+ disclosed reports curated · 6-phase workflow · validated through a Bugcrowd financial-target engagement.**

## Engagement Flow

A single bounty engagement walks through six phases. Skills auto-load by phase and topic.

The 7-Question Gate (Phase 4):

1. Can an attacker use this RIGHT NOW with a real HTTP request?
2. Is the impact on the program's accepted-impact list?
3. Is the asset in scope?
4. Does it work without privileged access an attacker can't get?
5. Is this not already known or documented behavior?
6. Can impact be proved beyond "technically possible"?
7. Is this not on the never-submit list?

One NO = KILL. Move on. This single discipline separates productive researchers from N/A noise.

## Quick Start

### One-step install (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter.git
cd Claude-BugHunter
./scripts/install.sh
```

That copies all 40 skills to `~/.claude/skills/`, all 15 commands to `~/.claude/commands/`, and sources `hunt.sh` from your shell rc.

### First engagement

```bash
hunt acme-bb              # scaffolds ~/Targets/acme-bb/ with CLAUDE.md, scope.md, findings/, evidence/, submissions.txt
cd ~/Targets/acme-bb
claude                    # opens Claude Code with engagement context
```

In Claude, describe what you're testing in plain English — *"I see a `?url=` parameter, looks SSRF-prone"* — and `hunt-ssrf` auto-loads with detection patterns, payloads, and the 11-bypass IP table.

### Drop-in usage (Claude.ai, Claude API, other harnesses)

```bash
# Copy a single SKILL.md into a Project's system prompt:
cat skills/hunt-rce/SKILL.md | pbcopy
# Paste into Claude.ai project instructions or API system prompt.
```

All skills are plain Markdown — also usable as personal cheat sheets without Claude.

For Burp Suite Pro MCP integration and the optional skill-regenerator setup, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). For the full workflow walkthrough with a worked example, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

---

## Authorization

These skills are intended for assets you **own** or have **written authorization to assess** (bug-bounty in-scope assets, pentest engagement letters, CTF challenges, your own infrastructure).

The skills include validation gates that auto-trigger when you point Claude at unverified third-party targets — `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate explicitly asks whether the asset is in scope (Q3) and on the program's accepted-impact list (Q2). The `bugcrowd-reporting` skill includes researcher-side hygiene (Bugcrowdninja alias, account-state restoration, friendly-tester posture) that signals legitimate authorized testing to the target's fraud team.

The bundle explicitly **excludes**: weaponizing 0-days against unauthorized targets, post-exploitation tooling, malware development, mass-targeting infrastructure. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full posture.

## Why this exists

Most bug-hunting Claude setups are either too generic (one big "security" prompt) or too fragmented (you bookmark 30 disclosed reports and re-read them every engagement). Neither scales past the second target.

This bundle was built and validated through a real Bugcrowd engagement on a major financial target. That engagement exposed four capability gaps that a starter 3-skill stack could not close:

1. **No hypothesis discipline** — drafts written before validation → wasted hours, hurt validity ratio
2. **No per-program reporting tactics** — VRT defaults auto-downgraded P3-worthy findings to P4
3. **No engagement coordination** — findings, evidence, and submission IDs scattered across folders
4. **No evidence hygiene** — screenshots leaked cookies and victim PII

The 24 per-class `hunt-*` skills address gap-zero (*"what should I look for"*) by codifying patterns from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports — Claude knows the actual chain templates real triagers paid for, not abstract OWASP Top 10. The other gaps are addressed directly by `triage-validation` (vendored), `bugcrowd-reporting`, `evidence-hygiene`, and the `hunt` shell scaffold (originals).

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] HackerOne MCP integration (currently only Burp MCP wired in)
- [ ] Per-engagement memory layer — pattern recall across targets
- [ ] Industry-specific hunt skills — `hunt-fintech-graphql`, `hunt-healthcare-fhir`, `hunt-gov-compliance`
- [ ] Program-rules-parser skill — auto-generate structured `scope.md` from program text
- [ ] Refresh `hunt-*` skills with newer disclosed reports (re-run `public-skills-builder`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (matching Claude-OSINT layout)

## About

Operational tradecraft accumulated across bug-bounty engagements and authorized pentests, codified into Claude skills. Platform-agnostic — slot into any engagement workflow you already use, or none.

**Author:** [ElementalSoul](https://github.com/elementalsouls) · GenAI Security Research

**Sister project:** [Claude-OSINT](https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-OSINT) — paired skills for the recon phase that this bundle picks up after.

**Vendored foundation:** [shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty](https://github.com/shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty) — methodology, validation, reporting, payload library (8 of 40 skills + 15 slash commands)

**Generator tool used (not vendored):** [shuvonsec/public-skills-builder](https://github.com/shuvonsec/public-skills-builder) — used to scaffold per-class skills from H1 disclosed reports

**Inspirations:**
- [archangel / douglasday](https://hackerone.com/) — top-10 H1 hunter; per-class skill pattern
- [Trail of Bits — `trailofbits/skills`](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills) — skill-authoring discipline
- [SecSkills — `trilwu/secskills`](https://github.com/trilwu/secskills) — subagent pattern
